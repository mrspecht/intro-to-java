Assignment 1


Project 1: Discount

A department store owner decided to implement a discount system for his
employees. The system, which will be developed in Java, will work as
follows:

  10% discount for supervisors
  15% discount for sales representatives
  20% discount for other employees
  Managers cannot participate in the discount system


System requirements

  1. Print a welcome message
  2. Ask for the employee's job title
  3. Ask for the price of the item the employee wants to buy. System will skip
     this step if the employee is a manager
  4. Print either the new price or a message to managers ("Managers cannot
     participate in the discount system")


Rubrics

  1. Code in a single Java file
  2. A method named checkDiscount
  3. A switch-case statement in checkDiscount()
  4. Program does not ask for the item when the employee is a manager
  5. Formatted outputs (ex. $30.45 instead of $30.444444447)
  6. Program works and delivers the expected results
  7. Code style (naming conventions, indentation, meaningful comments etc)
