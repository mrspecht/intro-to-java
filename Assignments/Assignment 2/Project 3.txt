Assignment 1


Project 3: Converter

Engineering students need a computer program to convert meters into different
units of measurement. The program should ask the user to enter a
distance in meters and then present the following menu of selections:

  1. Convert to kilometers
  2. Convert to inches
  3. Convert to feet
  4. Quit the program


System requirements

  1. The program will convert the distance to kilometers, inches, or feet,
     depending on the userâ€™s selection
  2. The program should continue to display the menu until the user enters '4'
     to quit the program
  3. The program should not accept negative numbers for the distance in meters
  4. If the user selects an invalid choice from the menu, the program should
     display an error message


Required methods

  1. A void method named showKilometers, which accepts the number of meters as
     an argument. The method should display the argument converted to
     kilometers. Convert the meters to kilometers using the following formula:

     kilometers = meters * 0.001

  2. A void method named showInches, which accepts the number of meters as an
     argument. The method should display the argument converted to inches.
     Convert the meters to inches using the following formula:

     inches = meters * 39.37

  3. A void method named showFeet, which accepts the number of meters as an
     argument. The method should display the argument converted to feet.
     Convert the meters to feet using the following formula:

     feet = meters * 3.281

  4. A void method named menu that displays the menu of selections. This method
     should not accept any arguments


Rubrics

  1. Code in a single Java file
  2. All required methods are implemented
  3. Formatted outputs (ex. 12.45 instead of 11.444444447)
  4. Program works and delivers the expected results
  5. Code style (naming conventions, indentation, meaningful comments etc)
