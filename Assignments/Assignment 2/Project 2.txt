Project 2: Population

A research laboratory needs a computer program to predict the size of a
population of organisms. The program should ask for the starting number of
organisms, their average daily population increase (as a percentage), and the
number of days they will multiply. For example, a population might begin with
two organisms, have an average daily increase of 50 percent, and will be
allowed to multiply for seven days. The program should use a loop to display
the size of the population for each day

  Day 1: 3.0 organisms
  Day 2: 4.5 organisms
  Day 3: 6.0 organisms
  Day 4: 9.0 organisms
  ...


Input validation

  1. Do not accept a number less than 2 for the starting size of the population
  2. Do not accept a negative number for average daily population increase
  3. Do not accept a number less than 1 for the number of days they will
     multiply


Rubrics

  1. Code in a single Java file
  2. Program works and delivers the expected results
  3. Code style (naming conventions, indentation, meaningful comments etc)
