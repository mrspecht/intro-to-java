Assignment 2


Project 2: Mailing list

Follow the steps below to develop a program to store customer data

  1. Design a class named Person with fields for holding a person’s name,
     address, and telephone number. Write one or more constructors and the
     appropriate mutator and accessor methods (setters and getters) for the
     class’s fields

  2. Next, design a class named Customer, which extends the Person class. The
     Customer class should have a field for a customer number and a boolean
     field indicating whether the customer wishes to be on a mailing list.
     Write one or more constructors and the appropriate mutator and accessor
     methods (setters and getters) for the class’s fields. Demonstrate an
     object of the Customer class in a simple program (a third class with the
     main() method)

  3. Implement a toString() method in Customer class to print the data about
     customers (the object)

  4. You should be able to store data using both constructor and mutator
     methods (setters)


Program output (example)

  Number: 1859
  Name: John Smith
  Address: 123 Notre Dame Ave
  Phone: (204) 234-5678
  Mailing list: Yes


Rubrics

  1. Code in a single Java class/file
  2. All required classes (3) and class members (constructors, setters and
     getters) are implemented
  3. Encapsulation is present in both classes, Person and Customer
  4. toString() method is implemented in Customer class
  5. Program works and delivers the expected results
  6. Code style (naming conventions, indentation, meaningful comments etc)
