Project 1: Tossing coins

Write a program that toss a coin. The main class (Coin) should contain the
following:

  1. A String named sideUp. The sideUp field will hold either 'heads' or
     'tails' indicating the side of the coin that is facing up
  2. A no-arg constructor that randomly determines the side of the coin that
     is facing up ('heads' or 'tails') and initializes the sideUp field
     accordingly
  3. A void method named toss() that simulates the tossing of the coin. When
     the toss method is called, it randomly determines the side of the coin
     that is facing up ('heads' or 'tails') and sets the sideUp field
     accordingly.
  4. A method named getSideUp that returns the value of the sideUp field



System requirements

  The program should create an instance of the class and display the side that
  is initially facing up. Then, use a loop to toss the coin 10 times. Each time
  the coin is tossed, display the side that is facing up. The program should
  keep count of the number of times heads is facing up and the number of times
  tails is facing up, and display those values after the loop finishes


Program output (example)

  Coin is current on tails
  Tossing coin...

  #1      Heads
  #2      Tails
  #3      Heads
  #4      Tails
  #5      Heads
  #6      Heads
  #7      Heads
  #8      Heads
  #9      Heads
  #10     Heads

  Heads wins: 8
  Tails wins: 2


Rubrics

  1. Code in a single Java file
  2. All required class members are implemented
  3. Both constructor and toss() method generate random results (heads/tails)
  4. Formatted output
  5. The program works and delivers the expected results
  6. Code style (naming conventions, indentation, meaningful comments etc)
